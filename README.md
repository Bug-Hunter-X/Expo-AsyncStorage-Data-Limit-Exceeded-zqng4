# Expo AsyncStorage Data Limit Exceeded

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using AsyncStorage in Expo applications: exceeding the storage limits.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior due to unclear error messages from AsyncStorage.

The `bug.js` file shows how exceeding the storage limit might cause the issue. The `bugSolution.js` file provides solutions on how to mitigate the issue.

## Solutions:

* **Use a different storage mechanism:** For larger data, consider using alternatives like SQLite, MMKV, or cloud-based storage like Firebase or Supabase.
* **Data compression:** Compress your data before storing it in AsyncStorage to reduce its size.
* **Data optimization:** Regularly review and remove unused or outdated data from AsyncStorage.
* **Chunking:** Break down large data sets into smaller chunks and store them individually.
* **Implement error handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch AsyncStorage exceptions gracefully. 

This repository provides example code showcasing the problem and potential solutions. Remember to choose the solution that best fits your application's specific needs and data volume.
